# NCAA-Sports-Database

I completed this project with two other classmates at JMU for CS 474. I mainly worked on the back end: I acquired the data from https://stats.ncaa.org and implemented the database with PostgreSQL. There is a simple front end website that uses PHP to display the data from the database.
